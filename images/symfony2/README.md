# whatwedo/symfony2

`whatwedo/symfony2` is an image configured for serving Symfony 2 applications. It has an installed [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) server, [PHP](http://www.php.net/) interpreter, PHP-FPM, git, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), an init system and a container healthcheck. It's based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/).

**Note:** You are currently looking at the unstable v2.0-dev branch. You should use the current stable version available at https://github.com/whatwedo/docker-base-images.

## Supported tags respective tag specific documentation links

* [`v2.0-dev`, `v2.0-dev-[BUILD-DATE]`](https://github.com/whatwedo/docker-base-images/blob/v2.0-dev/images/symfony2) (Alpine Linux 3.9, PHP 7.3)

There will be no `latest` tag available in future. Using a `latest` can cause a lot of troubles, especially if you are using Docker in production. Currently there is a latest tag available due to compatibility issues, but it will be remove in a short period of time.

## Development Workflow

It's sometimes quite hard to use Docker in your development workflow. We decided to face this problem with our own helper toolset called `dde` (available on GitHub at [whatwedo/dde](https://github.com/whatwedo/dde)). `dde` is optimised to use it together with this image. Using `dde` is just a suggestion and not a requirement to use this image in your project.
